Although legally I am Justin, I have always gone by Trey. Currently, I am in my third year at the University of San Diego, pursuing bachelor degrees in Computer Science and Behavioral Neuroscience. These studies are driven by passion. My entire life, I have witnessed my younger brother suffering from a condition called sensory processing disorder. His struggle has taught me to be sensitive to the often silent struggles of those around us. His perseverance has taught me patience, and his darkest moments taught me love and unconditional acceptance. My vision is to use my education in cognitive science, supplemented by my background in computer science, to learn more about sensory processing disorder, how it works, why it develops, and how to stop it. I am looking for internships that allow me to further advance my computer and coding skills, and/or understanding of neuroscience and abnormal psychology. My other passions include cooking, competing in and coaching tennis, and learning about other cultures through travel.
